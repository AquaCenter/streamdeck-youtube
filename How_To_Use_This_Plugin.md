# How to use the YouTube Channel Statistics Plugin

In order to access the YouTube Data v3 API, we need an API key.
An API key allows for up to 10'000 daily calls for free.

## Setup

To get an API key follow these steps:

1. Open the [Google Developer's API Dashboard](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard).
2. Create a project
3. Add the **YouTube Data v3 API** to the project
4. Create credentials to access the enabled APIs.
5. Copy the generated API key

You need the following information to make the plugin work:

* The YouTube API key generated above
* The channel id of the desired YouTube channel

You can get your channel id from the [Advanced Account Settings](https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced) on YouTube.

## How the plugin works
* The plugin loads the data from the YouTube Data API whenever it's activated. 
* You can also trigger it by pressing the button on your Stream Deck.

Feel free to ask questions in this repository by opening an issue. I will try to help you and add additional information to this page along the way.
